### Software engineer as a career?
If you want to how to code on your own, you need to 1- learn how to learn really well & 2- find a community that can help you get unstuck.

### HTML vs CSS vs Javascript:
HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are the core technologies of web development, each with a distinct and complementary role: **HTML provides the structure, CSS defines the presentation, and JavaScript adds interactivity and behavior.** They are not competing technologies but rather different layers that work together to create a functional and engaging webpage. 

|Feature  |	HTML (HyperText Markup Language) |	CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) |	JavaScript |
| --------| ----------| ----------| ----------|
|Purpose|	Defines the content and structure of the webpage using elements and tags.	| Controls the visual appearance, layout, colors, and fonts of HTML elements. | Enables dynamic, interactive features, animations, and complex application logic. 
|Language Type |	Markup language. |	Style sheet language. |	Full-fledged programming/scripting language.|

Use **Space repetition** to reset the forgetting curve. 
**Active recall**.

* Manage frustration
* Consistency
* Taking care of yourself

**Full stack, javascript**, if to get a job as fast as possible.
**Python**, if to learn computer science.

From a computer scientist’s perspective, the **Internet** is the global infrastructure that connects computers and networks using shared communication rules. It includes physical hardware like cables and routers as well as protocols that move data. The **World Wide Web** is one service that runs on top of the Internet and allows people to access documents and resources through webpages. In short, the Internet is the network itself, and the Web is an application that uses it.

Access to the Internet is typically provided by an **Internet Service Provider (ISP)**, which connects your device to the global network. When you connect through an ISP, your device is given an **IP address**, a numerical identifier that allows other devices to find and communicate with you. This address is essential for routing data across the Internet.

Most Internet communication follows the **client–server model**. A **client**, such as a web browser, requests information, while a **server** responds by sending data or services. When you visit a website, your browser acts as the client and the website’s machine acts as the server.

Because people use names instead of numbers, the **Domain Name System (DNS)** translates domain names into IP addresses. **Top-Level Domains (TLDs)**, such as “.com” or “.edu,” are part of this system and help organize domain names. DNS uses the TLD as part of the process to locate the correct server.

All Internet data transfer relies on **TCP/IP**. IP handles addressing and routing packets across networks, while TCP ensures the data arrives reliably and in order. Together, they form the foundation that allows different networks and devices to communicate.

The Web uses **HTTP** and **HTTPS** to transfer content between clients and servers. HTTP defines how web requests and responses work, while HTTPS adds encryption to protect data and verify the server’s identity. Most modern websites use HTTPS for security.

A **VPN (Virtual Private Network)** creates an encrypted tunnel between your device and another network. This hides your IP address from websites and protects your data from being intercepted, especially on public Wi-Fi. VPNs work on top of the existing Internet infrastructure rather than replacing it.

When you take a “**tour**” of the Web by visiting a site, your browser sends a request through your ISP. DNS resolves the site’s name to an IP address, TCP/IP delivers the data, and HTTP or HTTPS transfers the webpage. The server responds, and your browser displays the result, completing the process.

#### Introduced new features in **HTML5**:
* video
* audio
* canvas
* geolocation
* websockets

**The Golden Rule: seperation of concerns**
* HTML = Content / Structure
* CSS = Style
* JS = Behavior / Interaction

### HTML syntax 
spelling & grammer rules:
opening tag
closing tag
attribute & its value
enclosed text content

### Common HTML tags:
#### Document structure (must-know)  
These define the basic shape of every HTML page.
* `<html>` – Root element of the page
* `<head>` – Metadata and resources (not visible)
* `<title>` – Browser tab title
* `<meta>` – Character encoding, viewport, descriptions
* `<body>` – All visible content

#### Text and content
Used for displaying readable content.
* `<h1>–<h6>` – Headings (importance levels)
* `<p>` – Paragraph
* `<a>` – Link
* `<span>` – Inline container for styling
* `<strong>` – Important text (bold, semantic)
* `<em>` – Emphasized text (italic, semantic)

#### Layout and structure
Essential for organizing pages.
* `<div>` – Block-level container (very common)
* `<section>` – Grouped thematic content
* `<article>` – Standalone content unit
* `<nav>` – Navigation links
* `<header>` – Page or section header
* `<footer>` – Page or section footer

#### Lists and tables
Used for structured data.
* `<ul>, <ol>` – Lists
* `<li>` – List item
* `<table>` – Table
* `<tr>, <td>, <th>` – Table rows and cells

#### Forms and user input
Critical for interactivity.
* `<form>` – Input container
* `<input>` – User input field
* `<label>` – Input label
* `<button>` – Clickable button
* `<textarea>` – Multi-line input

#### Media and scripts
Enable images and behavior.
* `<img>` – Image
* `<script>` – JavaScript
* `<link>` – External CSS
* `<style>` – Inline CSS
